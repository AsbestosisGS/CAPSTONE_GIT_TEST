New Folder Created: Shaders

That is where I will place my shader scripts.

- Note that I applied my shader on all of the Materials in the Materials Folder
and the Prefabs in the Prefab folder.

- Also note that the shader has it's default settings that can be tweeked via
the inspecter. It would be a good idea to know what what are the desired values
to get the full effect of the Shader.

- Finally, I did not apply my shader on any of Precils models since in order for
me to Apply it, I will need to be able to edit the material(s) being
used on the models. Or Simply we create a new material with the shader and apply
it.


The Following Prefabs do not have the Shader:

Floating Enemy Sphere
Spliting Enemy

As they are each missing the script that their component is Linked to.
